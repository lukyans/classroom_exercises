    Shift adds an ellement to the beggining of an array 
    Unshift deletes first element of an array
Name 3 ways to retrieve 4 from this array: [4,3,5]

    ["Beth", "Lauren", "Ilana"].map {|name| name[0]}
    #array_name.each do |name|
    #first_nitials = name(0)
    end

Classes and instance methods

When you’re defining a class, how do you store attributes?
    class className #defining a class
    variable_name = className.new("hot", 100) #creating new instance variable of a class using method .new and storing attributes inside ()
What is the difference between attr_readers, attr_writers, and attr_accessors? What do each do?
    attr_reader # methods replaces getter method 
    attr_writers # replaces settor method
    attr_accessors #does both 
What method corresponds with .new when you create a new instance of a class?
    initialize
