#we are going to run the program until all numbers are sorted

#We take first element of array compare it with the next element in array

        #we swap them (how do we swap?)
        #add number (counter) to proceed to second element of the array
        #run this block until the length of the array ends 
             #(length of array is 4. We will compare counter with the length of array)

    #if running through the program first element is less then next one 
        #we go back and repeat the loop
